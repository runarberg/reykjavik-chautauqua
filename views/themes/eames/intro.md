Whether you know Charles and Ray Eames or not, you are probably
familiar with their work, particularly their chair designs. Despite
the pervasiveness of their designs, most people have no idea what a
wonderfully kooky and inventive power couple the two were. Together
they collaborated on art, architecture, furniture design, industrial
design, film and photography (And probably more). We went back and
forth on the idea of devoting an entire month to the two verses a more
inclusive theme of prolific makers and doers and we decided that the
Eameses were so special and such an inspiration to us that we would
really like to get to know them better. That being said, we welcome
conversations about other interesting creative types.
