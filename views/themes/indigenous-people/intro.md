We will kick off our forum with a focus on indigenous people. Why?
Well, we felt that it would be a nice preamble to future topics,
setting some context and somekind of a flow. Its also a little bit
arbritrary, but we hope that you like our choice.

If my brain were a library organized by the dewey decimal system, the
section around 305.8 would look pretty sparce. Yup, you guessed it,
thats where the books on indigenous people woule be... Although I love
folk art and therefore the costume and art of indigenous people, I
pretty much draw a blank when presented with any tribe name that goes
beyond national identity. I think this isn’t for lack of exposure, but
rather lack of context. So this month I’d like to take a more
contextual look at different indigenous groups.
