We will kick off our forum with a focus on indigenous people. Why?
Well, we felt that it would be a nice preamble to future topics,
setting some context and some kind of a flow. Its also a little bit
arbitrary, but we hope that you like our choice.

Although we want to explore the diversity (and similarity) of
traditional art, costume and custom, we want to go beyond a
superficial appreciation of aesthetics and also take a look at the
modern role of indigenous people around the world. What is the status
of indigenous people living more traditional lifestyles versus
indigenous people living in urban settings? What does history tell us?
What are some current issues? What are some cool projects? Etc.
