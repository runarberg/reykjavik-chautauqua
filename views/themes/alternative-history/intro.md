We would like to end the year with a look at history through an
alternative lens. By this we mean history told from different
perspective, not sci-fi novels with alien Naziâ€™s winning the war
(although, if you know of a good alternative history novel, please
feel free to share!). History is so much a narrative of who is
documenting it that it becomes hugely subjective and even
dynamic. What history would you rather know? What history do you think
is just plain wrong?
