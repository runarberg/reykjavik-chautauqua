In these tumultuous times it helps to look at the past to understand
the present. What can past revolutions and revolutionary actions tell
us about today? What revolutions have been a success and what
revolutions have been an utter failure? How have people’s demand’s
changed over time, if it all? How do technological revolutions fit
into all of this? Does history just repeat itself or do circumstances
change and cause continuous improvement and/or decline.
