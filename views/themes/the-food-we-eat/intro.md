March will be a an exploration of food beyond pure gastronomics
(but not excluding). We would like to look at food, past, present and
future, all over the world, from medicine to fashion (basically any
aspect of food from the most banal to the greatest stretches of the
imagination). We are already planning an entire show on milk! Yes,
milk!  Stay tuned for more.
