Good morning comrades! 

Over the dog days we will embrace communism in all its might. Let’s
talk about the failure of capitalism, about class warfare, about the
revolution, and the one solution to all the injustice done to the wage
laborer. Let Marx’s manifesto shine through the Bolshevik revolution,
to the liberation of neo-colonized third world states. Learn about
communism’s heavy hitters, greatest successes and failures. And
remember, barba non facit philosophum, a beard doesn’t make one a
philosopher. So, get in the communal spirit and contribute to the
discussion at Reykjavík Chautauqua!
