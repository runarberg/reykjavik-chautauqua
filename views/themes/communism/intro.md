Good morning comrades!

I like Communists for the same reason I like hipsters. I share a lot
with their philosophy, we have the same contempt towards the
establishment (be it capitalism or pop-culture) and we are all willing
to have lengthy conversations on how much better our world-view is
then that of the socially alienated wage-slaves. But at the same time,
I know my view are so much better, smarter and correct then theirs. In
other words, I like communists and hipsters because at least they are
not as lame as most folks, and at the same time, I’m so much cooler
then they.

Over the dog days we will embrace communism in all its might. Let’s
talk about the failure of capitalism, about class warfare, about the
revolution, and the one solution to all the injustice done to the wage
laborer. Let Marx’s manifesto shine through the Bolshevik revolution,
to the liberation of neo-colonized third world states. Join the cause,
join the social movement. United against tyranny. Here at Reykjavík
Chahutauqua.
