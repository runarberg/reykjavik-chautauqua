Every once in a while you hear about special individual who is acting
on principle and stubbornly determined to do things their own
way. Sometimes these people are doing something quite unique but other
times they are just living out their life. September is about
recognizing these independent people by sharing their existence. One
of our inspirations for this monthâ€™s theme is a
[short documentary](http://www.folkstreams.net/film,287) about an
elderly Shuswap Native American named Augusta. This documentary was
filmed in 1976 and Augusta is likely long dead, but her resilient
spirit lives on to touch people worlds away.
