Who are we
----------

Our names are [Chantal Uto](mailto:c_uto@hotmail.com) and
[Rúnar Berg](mailto:runarberg@zoho.com), we live in Reykjavík and like
to have fun. We have the most fun when we are learning and doing
something new. This is the kind of experience that we are trying to
share at our new web space. We really like pizza, icecream and coffee,
but not necessarily at the same time.

How did we make this so pretty
------------------------------

We use good amount of free and open source tools. Most noticeably the
beautiful font faces we use are
[Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/) for the heading and
[Crimson Text](http://aldusleaf.org/0-crimson.html) for the
paragraphs. Our app is powered by [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
that runs on [Node.js](nodejs.org). We are happy to show you
[our code](https://github.com/runarberg/reykjavik-chautauqua) as well.
