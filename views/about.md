Who are we
----------

Our names are [Chantal Uto](mailto:c_uto@hotmail.com) and
[Rúnar Berg](mailto:runarberg@zoho.com), we live in Reykjavík and
love to party.

How did we make this so pretty
------------------------------

We use good amount of free and open source tools. Most noticeably the
beautiful font faces we use are
[Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/) for the heading and
[Crimson Text](http://aldusleaf.org/0-crimson.html) for the
paragraphs. Our app is powered by [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
that runs on [Node.js](nodejs.org). We are happy to show you
[our code](https://github.com/runarberg/reykjavik-chautauqua) as well.
