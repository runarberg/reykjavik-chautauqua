Welcome to our social club!

We are excited to present the *next phase of our cinema*.  This time
around we would like to transcend beyond entertainment. Our cinema
will be just one dimension of our new social forum. A while back we
had an idea about having some guided discussion group about various
topics that could include different events. Something like a book club
but not necessarily books and perhaps a bit cooler. Our website will
be the platform for our forum and participation is highly recommended!
Each month we’ll have a different topic that we’ll post on and have a
relevant film screening. The success of our “social club” relies
heavily on the participation and comments of others and the diversity
of perspectives, otherwise it would just be us ranting on a
blog... Our goal isn’t political or necessarily intellectual, we just
want to have fun while learning and exploring some things that we find
interesting, and we welcome you to join us.
